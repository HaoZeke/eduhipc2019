A collaborative effort on teaching high-performance-computing techniques in a
domain specific manner. This documentation site is meant to introduce and
supplement the teaching methodology for HPC computing accepted for presentation
at [EduHiPC 2019](https://hipc.org/eduhipc-2019/).

### Abstract

    We describe a general work-flow which scales intuitively to high-performance computing (HPC) clusters for different domains of scientific computation. We demonstrate our methodology with a radial distribution function calculation in C++, with mental models for FORTRAN and Python as well. We present a pedagogical framework for the development of guided concrete incremental techniques to incorporate domain specific knowledge and transfer existing expertise for developing high-performance, platform-independent, reproducible scientific software. This is effected by presenting the acceleration of a radial distribution function, a well known algorithm in computational chemistry. Thus we assert that for domain specific algorithms, there is a language-independent pedagogical methodology which may be leveraged to ensure best practices for the scientific HPC community with minimal cognitive dissonance for practitioners and students.
