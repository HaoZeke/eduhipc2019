We determine the computational efﬁciency of such schemes quantitatively and present a hueristic based on space ﬁlling curves to minimize complexity. The sparse matrix kernel is shown to be optimized by the utilization of Bi-directional Incremental Compressed Row Storage (BICRS). Extensions to high performance clusters and parallelization are also derived.},

  abstract = {Existing systems for software deployment are neither safe nor sufficiently flexible. Primary safety issues are the inability to enforce reliable specification of component dependencies, and the lack of support for multiple versions or variants of a component. This renders deployment operations such as upgrading or deleting components dangerous and unpredictable. A deployment system must also be flexible (i.e., policy-free) enough to support both centralised and local package management, and to allow a variety of mechanisms for transferring components. In this paper we present Nix, a deployment system that addresses these issues through a simple technique of using cryptographic hashes to compute unique paths for component instances.},

  doi = {10/chdgqw},
  abstract = {Scientific computation has grown in scope over the years, but today's needs are far beyond what people have experienced in traditional scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Although the term "computing" might also mean information processing as opposed to numerical computation, it's increasingly difficult to draw a clear boundary between the two. As more disciplines require or desire computational skills, the crowds we teach will include not only future engineers and natural scientists but also social scientists, business analysts, or even casual learners. People in this learning community will contribute to computational science not by theoretically exploring the properties of numerical algorithms, but by applying or modifying existing numerical methods or methodologies to successfully solve problems in their respective fields. How we teach numerical computation to the crowds must be taken far beyond the discussions on the relevance and advantages of computational software or programming languages. Whether repackaging what we teach would prepare students better - numerically speaking - remains to be seen. However, we must find ways to integrate modern scientific computation research results into our curricula.},

@inproceedings{smithSoftwareCarpentry2018,
  title = {Beyond {{Software Carpentry}}},
  abstract = {About 20 years ago the need for scientists and engineers to have basic knowledge of software development skills and tools became apparent. Without these so-called software carpentry skills, developers were wasting time and compromising the quality of their work. Since that time great progress has been made with software carpentry, as evidenced by the growing understanding of the importance of tools, and by the growth of the namesake Software Carpentry foundation and other similar projects. With scientific software developers now prepared to move forward, we should turn our attention to the next logical step after carpentry: Software Engineering (SE) applied to Scientific Computing Software (SCS). Past attempts with SE for SCS have not always been successful; therefore, this paper proposes a vision for future success, including SE specifically adapting ideas to SCS, SCS recognizing the value of software artifacts other than the code, and all parties increasing the emphasis on empirical evidence and the quality of replicability. Several ideas are proposed for turning the proposed vision into a reality, including promoting requirements documentation for replicability, building assurance cases for correctness (and other qualities), and automatic generation of all documentation and code.},

  abstract = {A growing body of evidence has shown that active learning has a considerable advantage over traditional lecture for student learning in undergraduate STEM classes, but there have been few large-scale studies to identify the specific types of activities that have the greatest impact on learning. We therefore undertook a large-scale, curriculum-wide study to investigate the effects of time spent on a variety of classroom activities on learning gains. We quantified classroom practices and related these to student learning, assessed using diagnostic tests written by over 3700 students, across 31 undergraduate biology classes at a research-intensive university in the Pacific Northwest. The most significant positive predictor of learning gains was the use of group work, supporting the findings of previous studies. Strikingly, we found that the addition of worksheets as an active learning tool for in-class group activities had the strongest impact on diagnostic test scores. This particular low-tech activity promotes student collaboration, develops problem solving skills, and can be used to inform the instructor about what students are struggling with, thus providing opportunities for valuable and timely feedback. Overall, our results indicate that group activities with low barriers to entry, such as worksheets, can result in significant learning gains in undergraduate science.},

  abstract = {A typical mathematics assignment consists primarily of practice problems requiring the strategy introduced in the immediately preceding lesson (e.g., a dozen problems that are solved by using the Pythagorean theorem). This means that students know which strategy is needed to solve each problem before they read the problem. In an alternative approach known as interleaved practice, problems from the course are rearranged so that a portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems in an interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a strategy on the basis of the problem itself, as they must do when they encounter a problem during a comprehensive examination or subsequent course. In the experiment reported here, 126 seventh-grade students received the same practice problems over a 3-month period, but the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved practice or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded with a review session, followed 1 or 30 days later by an unannounced test. Compared with blocked practice, interleaved practice produced higher scores on both the immediate and delayed tests (Cohen’s ds ϭ 0.42 and 0.79, respectively).},

Although analogies are important teaching tools, it is important for teachers to be aware of potential pitfalls. Limits in relevant knowledge and processing capacity increase the likelihood that learners fail to notice or benefit from analogies in teaching. The aim of the teacher should be to assist the learner in developing veridical causal models of the domain or deep understanding of content structures. Major strategies for using analogies effectively in teaching include guided comparison of examples, highlighting of relations by principles and visual diagrams, ordering examples to encourage progressive alignment, and focusing attention on subgoals. The benefits of relational instruction are most apparent when the learner is later faced with novel problems that require extension and adaptation of the earlier examples used in training. We provide a list of recommendations for analogy-based teaching practices that can be customized to different learning contexts and training needs.},

  abstract = {In this case study, we aim to explore the characteristics and the reception of files uploaded to Zenodo and the role the repository plays itself in generating usage. To this end, we first apply descriptive statistics on Zenodo’s full set of data record metadata with DOIs until and including January 2017 (n=141,777 records). Second, we estimate the coverage of Zenodo datasets in the Data Citation Index (DCI) as well as of Zenodo journal articles in the Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A\&HCI), Zenodo books and book chapters in the Book Citation Index, and Zenodo conference papers in the Proceedings Citation Index, and analyse their citedness according to the different data record types in Zenodo (e.g., journal article, dataset, book, or conference paper). Third, we provide a bibliometric analysis of Zenodo records by using different metrics for citedness, including citation, usage and altmetrics. Altmetrics data are gathered from two of the most popular tools for altmetric analyses, PlumX and Altmetric.com, and we compare the results. Moreover, we study how open access and DOIs provided by Zenodo influence the impact of Zenodo data records and we find a tendency towards a positive relationship between permissive access rights and altmetrics in certain data records.},

  abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

  abstract = {Parallel Programming with OpenACC is a modern, practical guide to implementing dependable computing systems. The book explains how anyone can use OpenACC to quickly ramp-up application performance using high-level code directives called pragmas. The OpenACC directive-based programming model is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful, approach to accelerators without significant programming effort.  Author Rob Farber, working with a team of expert contributors, demonstrates how to turn existing applications into portable GPU accelerated programs that demonstrate immediate speedups. The book also helps users get the most from the latest NVIDIA and AMD GPU plus multicore CPU architectures (and soon for Intel® Xeon PhiTM as well). Downloadable example codes provide hands-on OpenACC experience for common problems in scientific, commercial, big-data, and real-time systems. Topics include writing reusable code, asynchronous capabilities, using libraries, multicore clusters, and much more. Each chapter explains how a specific aspect of OpenACC technology fits, how it works, and the pitfalls to avoid. Throughout, the book demonstrates how the use of simple working examples that can be adapted to solve application needs.Presents the simplest way to leverage GPUs to achieve application speedupsShows how OpenACC works, including working examples that can be adapted for application needsAllows readers to download source code and slides from the book's companion web page},
